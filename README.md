Refractoring Horiseon website by adding semantic structure of the html elements and including comments before each section so developer has a clear understanding of its purpose. Cleaning up css so that there is less code as possible to help user get a clearer picture.

Added meta tags into the html head section. Changed the many div tags in the html to header, article and footer tags so they are more specific to the browser and developer.

Added descriptions to the css to explain the purpose of each section. And grouped the header, search engine optimization, online reputation management and social media marketing sections together reducing the amount of code and kept the webpage working the same.
